## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

	âœˆI'm an Aerospace Graduate student interested in airbreathing propulsion design and performance analysis.
 
 	âš¡I'm also a structures engineer in the nuclear industry.

	ðŸ”¥I'm currently modeling GE's F404 engine using pyCycle, with hopes to replicate its real performance and validate it in NPSS.

Happy to connect!
