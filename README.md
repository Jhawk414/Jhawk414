## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- âœˆ I'm an aerospace graduate student interested in airbreathing propulsion design.

- ðŸ”¥ I'm currently modeling GE's F404 engine using pyCycle, with hopes to replicate its real performance & validate it in NPSS.

- âš¡ I also analyze complex structures in PWR nuclear plants.

Happy to connect!
